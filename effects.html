               <li>All of the noble gases, including krypton and xenon, contained within the reactor were released immediately into the atmosphere <br>
            by the first steam explosion.The atmospheric release of xenon-133, with a half-life of 5 days, is estimated at 5200 PBq. </li>
               <li>50 to 60% ofall core radioiodine in the reactor, about 1760 PBq (1760×1015 becquerels), or about 0.4 kg, was released, as a mixture of sublimed <br>
            vapour, solid particles, and organic iodine compounds. Iodine-131 has a half-life of 8 days. </li>
               <li>20 to 40% of all core caesium-137 was released, 85 PBq in all. Caesium was released in aerosol form; caesium-137, along with <br>
               isotopes of strontium, are the two primary elements preventing the Chernobyl exclusion zone being re-inhabited. 8.5×1016 Bq equals <br>
               24 kilograms of caesium-137.Cs-137 has a half-life of 30 years.</li>
               <li>Tellurium-132, half-life 78 hours, an estimated 1150 PBq was released.</li>
               <li>An early estimate for total nuclear fuel material released to the environment was 3±1.5%; this was later revised to 3.5±0.5%. <br>
               This corresponds to the atmospheric emission of 6 t of fragmented fuel.</li>
