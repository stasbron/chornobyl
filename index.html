    <p>The Chernobyl disaster, also referred to as the Chernobyl accident, was a catastrophic nuclear accident.<br> 
    It occurred on 26 April 1986 in the No.4 light water graphite moderated reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near Pripyat, <br>
    in what was then part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union (USSR)</p>
    <p>During a late night safety test which simulated power-failure and in which safety systems were deliberately turned off, <br>
    a combination of inherent reactor design flaws, together with the reactor operators arranging the core in a manner <br>
    contrary to the checklist for the test, eventually resulted in uncontrolled reaction conditions that flashed water <br>
    into steam generating a destructive steam explosion and a subsequent open-air graphite "fire".This "fire" produced <br>
    considerable updrafts for about 9 days, that lofted plumes of fission products into the atmosphere, with the estimated <br>
    radioactive inventory that was released during this very hot "fire" phase, approximately equal in magnitude to the airborne<br>
    fission products released in the initial destructive explosion. Practically all of this radioactive material would then go <br>
    on to fall-out/precipitate onto much of the surface of the western USSR and Europe</p>
    <p>The Chernobyl accident dominates the Energy accidents sub-category, of most disastrous nuclear power plant accident in history, <br>
    both in terms of cost and casualties. It is one of only two nuclear energy accidents classified as a level 7 event (the maximum <br>
    classification) on the International Nuclear Event Scale, the other being the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011.The <br>
    struggle to safeguard against scenarios which were, at many times falsely,perceived as having the potential for greater catastrophe<br>
    and the later decontamination efforts of the surroundings, ultimately involved over 500,000 workers and cost an estimated 18 billion rubles.<br>
    During the accident, blast effects caused 2 deaths within the facility and later 29 firemen and employees died in the days-to-months <br>
    afterward from acute radiation syndrome, with the potential for long-term cancers still being investigated.</p>
    
    <p>The remains of the No.4 reactor building were enclosed in a large sarcophagus (radiation shield) by December 1986, <br>
    at a time when what was left of the reactor was entering the cold shut-down phase; the enclosure was built quickly as <br>
    occupational safety for the crews of the other undamaged reactors at the power station, with No.3 continuing to produce <br>
    electricity into 2000.</p>
    
    <p>The accident motivated safety upgrades on all remaining Soviet-designed reactors in the RBMK (Chernobyl No.4) family,<br>
    of which eleven continued to power electric grids as of 2013.</p>
